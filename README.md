# Wiper_Motor_Servo
converting a wiper motor into a strong servo motor

I had an old wiper motor made by Bosch. 

They are very powerful, they draw 2 to 3A, do not run very fast but have really a lot of torque, much more than what I would ever need to rotate a solar tracker (even a big size one !).

However these motors are DC ones without any solution to control their position. 

So I decided to add a cheap 12bits magnetic encoder AS5600.
